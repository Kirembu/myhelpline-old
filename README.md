MyHelpline is a communication framework for support call centers.
The goal is simple, to help users easily communicate to support agents.

Being a communication framework we have focused heavily on the voice and messaging.
Currently the application integrates with Asterisk the opensource PBX and hardware PBX such as GOIP and Yeastar MyPBX.
Support for other IP PBX Software such as Freeswitch is also on the pipe line.

The name is as random as it can get. "MyPBX" might have inspired some of the naming, however inadvertently.
